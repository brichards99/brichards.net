The following were books I finished reading during the month of June.

* [Lolita - Vladmir Nabokov](https://www.amazon.com/Lolita-Vladimir-Nabokov-ebook/dp/B07DBRQNG7/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1528998103&sr=8-4&keywords=lolita)
* [The Last Jedi - Jason Fry](https://www.amazon.com/Last-Jedi-Expanded-Star-Wars-ebook/dp/B075HZNYV9/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1528998226&sr=1-1&keywords=the+last+jedi)
* [Red Rain - R.L. Stine](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Rain-Novel-R-L-Stine-ebook/dp/B007EDOT6W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529068644&sr=8-1&keywords=red+rain+rl+stine)
* Zeroes - Chuck Wending

So I was never an R.L. Stine guy, having been born about a decade late to really appreciate his books when I was the right age for them. I remember, however, the summer I worked at a Lutheran church camp near Hershey where the nine and ten year olds demanded that we read aloud from whichever Stine book they had brought along. The stories were like candy for these kids, and I remember some of them being pretty creepy. Fast-paced, interesting characters, and some twisty little weird tales. I picked up Red Rain just to see for myself if any of that good storytelling would translate into an adult book well, and holy shit did it work. Red Rain is not entirely predictable, and the thread of the story is fun to follow. The adults in the tale get up to adult business from time to time, and that added just the right nuance to the troubles they found themselves in. Loved it.

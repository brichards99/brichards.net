I thoroughly enjoyed the books I read this month, but the standout title for me has to be Ice Cold. I had picked this one up on a goof because I thought that it was a television tie-in kind of like the Nikki Heat books with Castle. The story quickly pulled me in and I found myself completely taken away by the writing. Once I finished it and realized how much I wanted to read more I forced myself to do the smart thing and look into the author, Tess Gerritsen. I learned that Gerritsen's Rizzoli and Isles novels predate the show -- rather than the other way around -- and while the show is fine the novels apparently outclass them easily. I will be looking further into this series.

Another standout this month, by the way, was Paul Tremblay's The Little Sleep. Before his current round of well known horror novels (such as Head Full of Ghosts, which rocks) Tremblay wrote a few detective novels around a narcolepticwith some curious detecting to do. Straightforward, readable, and interesting. There is a bit of formulaic noir going on here, but that's what you read these kind of books for, right?

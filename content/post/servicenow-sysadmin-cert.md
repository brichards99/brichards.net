So earlier today I had a little bit of time because of an instance upgrade to kill, and so I decided to retake my ServiceNow Certified System Administrator certification. Which is kind of a mouthful, but it's just not that important to enough people for there to be a handy acronym like CCNA or SAT.

But it's important to me, and I passed. Woo!

For people who work on the ServiceNow platform the system administrator certification is the most common shingle to seek, and it demonstrates that know enough about where all the levers and gears are in ServiceNow to be permitted admin access without everyone else in the organization sweating bullets. I took it the first time several years ago, and a lot has changed in the platform since then. Fortunately this is the kind of cert where if you work on the platform every single day and pay attention to what other people are doing with it too you pretty much don't have to study. Pretty much.

Something I appreciate about this certification is that testing company ServiceNow uses can handle remote proctoring so you can take the exam at home. It's kind of creepy because you have to rig up an external webcam that is pointed at both you and your computer, and a person is actually on the other end of the camera watching. Early on in the test I was frozen out and presented with a message to remove my watch, and then I was asked to turn down the pickup on my computer's microphone. Apparently the proctor finds the sound of someone typing to be as nauseating as I do.

But whatever. It keep me from having to drive to some test center to take the exam.

This was actually a pretty heavy month of reading, and there were two books here I would gladly revisit. Sleeping Beauties carried me through a whole world, very much in the flavor of other Stephen King books. His collaboration with his son is really enjoyable storytelling.

And then there is the Tomb. Wilson's story has all the ingredients for a meaty thriller, and it's a good justification for me to push into the rest of his books, which I know includes the really well regarded Repairman Jack series.

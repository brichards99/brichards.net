*Obligatory preamble: This post is intended for students in any of my online classes. I post entries in this blog in order to help you succeed in the unique environment of an online college course, which I hope you realize is a lot different than other kinds of classes.*

So here we go with a new year. This is the time when everyone is making resolutions and getting pumped up for a new fitness routine, a cleaner house, or maybe a new adventure. I just want to talk about being a good student. 

It's a game. Pure and simple. 

If you get a good grade, you win. If you spend your money on an online degree and don't get that degree, you lose. Everything else along the way

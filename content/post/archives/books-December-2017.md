Over time I have owned both a hardcover copy and the audio-cassette version of From a Buick 8, yet I've never finished it. The story is set in Western Pennsylvania here and throws a local bone out every once in a while, but the premise of it all is genuinely fascinating. A kind of totem of the kind of cross-universe fantasy Stephen King has introduced in so many of his books. Well I finally finished it, and it was of course worth it.

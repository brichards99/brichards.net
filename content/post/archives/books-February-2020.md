Tried some of Kealan Patrick Burke's other titles this month, and I was not disappointed in the least. Jack & Jill was a chilling story with an unforgettable outcome. Turtle Boy presented a set of young characters that were really memorable and relatable. I'm convinced of this author.

I picked up Dracula Returns based on a recommendation I found on Facebook, and I while I did these carry-forwards of the Dracula storyline the writing was just not for me.

Bird Box: damn. I saw the movie first, although it was a while ago, and this was another good example of both book and movie presenting a story (and a world!) in complimentary fashiohn.

And I continue to enjoy Tess Gerritsen's writing. It's true that I tried her books first because I was hoping for an interesting novelization of the Rizzoli & Isles TV show, but what I found was that the books came first and are outstanding. Highly recommended.

Books finished during February 2019:

* [You Are Here - Thich Nat Hanh](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8USOG6/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
* [Hack: A LitRPG Novel (Tower of Gates Book 1) - Paul Bellow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CRWBPZJ/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
* [Hunter Hunterson & Sons - Scott Sigler](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MXS531G/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title_ab_amzn)

Pretty light work this month. I had a lot going on with my job, so I was somewhat distracted. 

I'll say this -- I love me some Scott Sigler. He's somewhat crude, especially in this Hunter Hunterson & Sons volume (which is really just a small collection of short stories.) But he's entertaining and always original. 

Hack was a first for me. This was my virgin voyage with LitRPG, a genre of fiction that delivers a narrative version of role-playing. In this case it was a narrative story built around a handful of friends getting trapped in a virtual reality -ish role-playing video game. It was actually pretty fun.

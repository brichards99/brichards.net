So this was a pretty heavy month for audiobooks. Every single book except Mount Dragon was from Audible, and the reason I kept up this pace was simply because the narrations were so good. I got the wrong link here for Tom Sawyer, because the edition I listend to was narrated by Wil Wheaton. It was terrific. Even the Adventures of Tom Stranger, which was weird and by an author I had never heard of before, was thoroughly enjoyable as much because of Adam Baldwin's narration as because the storytelling was so witty.

I'll say this about Viktor Frakl, however: this book was not to betaken lightly. Very often I listen to audiobooks at 1.5 or even 2.0 speed, especially if the narrator has a good, clear voice. Man's Search for Meaning focusedon material that bore enough emotional weight that I listened to it at normal speed and gave it my full attention. I can see why it's on so many 'must read' lists.

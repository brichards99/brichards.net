Looks like a pretty heavy reading list this month, although there are a few shorter works (Pay the Ghost, the Roo) that I zipped through quickly (although the Roo is book length, but a quick and super fun read.) There are also two poetry collections here and a book that I had started years ago but finally decided to finish (Sleep Starved.)

But here's the one: Off Season. I ready some great stuff here (Janz is an author who never lets me down, for one), but Off Season grabbed me by the giblets and did not let go. After I finished it I learned that I was rereading an expanded version which was a bit more gory I guess than what had originally been released, and I'm grateful for that. Damn could this man write, and the brutality of the novel's events were overshadowed by the immersiveness of the small world he created for it.

I also want to mention that Lebbon's Pay the Ghost was a beautiful, brief piece. Kind of haunting, kind of sweet. I enjoyed every syllable.

 I read American Dream Hunters because I participated in a writing workshop (called Night of the Writing Dead) hosted by the author, and I wasn't disappointed. This isn't exactly Shirley Jackson, but at the same time it was tightly written and comprised of a very interesting premise.

Paul Tremblay rocks. Nuff said. I know these detective stories were not very successful for him, but I absolutely love the protagonist, and I think he does a great job of putting together interesting whodunit plots.

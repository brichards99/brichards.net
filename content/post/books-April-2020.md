This month I benefitted from some of the large warchest of pieces I had decided to pick up early in the pandemic. When lockdowns started to really affect people across the country there was a period of time when authors and publishers posted books either for free or at a deep discount to provide people with entertainment while being stuck at home. I must have picked up at least a dozen ebooks, and perhaps a half dozen audiobooks. Many of them were novellas or long form stories, but nonetheless good stuff.

Time Lebbon's Berserk is actually a full length novel, but I picked it up as part of a handful of his books made available for free. Lots of fun, and set up with a kind of chilling back story. Lots of fun.

I'm a sucker for novelizations, so naturally I grabbed the Rise of Skywalker book when it was released. I had been hoping for some revelations about the characters that did not make it into the movie, especially since this 'Expanded Edition' was kind of billed that way. Didn't find much, but that did not at all take a way from the fun. Solo was kind of the same way.

And then there was the Drwaing of the Three. I decided a few months ago to re-read the entire Dark Tower series, and it has been so long since I read these through the first time that I found myself getting swept up in the storytelling as if it were the first time. I think I have a lot of fun ahead of me.

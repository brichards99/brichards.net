I never read Terry Brooks back in high school when I was, you know, scheduled to do so by way of my active participation in the girl-less nerds of D&D club. I really missed out, so now I am burdened with having to dig through these beautiful, thick, well worn books as an adult. Darn.

* Sword of Shannara - Terry Brooks 
* Panacea - F. Paul Wilson 
* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck - Mark Manson
* the Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up - Marie Kondo

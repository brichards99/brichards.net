A pretty light month here in March, due mostly to some pretty heavy schedules at work. No regrets, though, as I was really glad to take the time to read Who Goes There? This novella was the inspiration for the Thing movies, and I enjoyed seeing some of the similarities and differences. It had a really creepy fifties sci-fi paranoia feel to it, and was speculative in its own way. Would definitely recommend to others.

The following were books I finished reading during the month of June.

* [Punch Me Up to the Gods: A Memoir by Brian Broome)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55574594-punch-me-up-to-the-gods)
* [Vicarious by Rhett C. Bruno](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57342343-vicarious)
* [Sixty Poems by Charles Simic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13034322-sixty-poems)
* [Homo Deus: A History of Tomorrow by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus)
* [The Long Walk by Richard Bachman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9014.The_Long_Walk)

This was a heavy month for reading, since Homo Deus itself was no joke. One of the best nonfiction books I've read since I chewed my way through all of Carl Sagan's books back in high school. Some incredibly thought-provoking material here, particularly with regards to the advent of humanism and its implications for how our society is evolving. I may need to go back and reread this one, as I experienced it as an audiobook, and to be frank I fear I missed out on some important details. At the very least it would be worth it to read these words again.

Charles Simic is my new go-to poet. I learned about him from the reading list of a poet I follow on Twitter, and his visual style really appeals to me. Fortunately a number of his collections are available through the library, so I foresee some binging in my future.

And then there is Brian Broome. This Pittsburgh writer and poet is someone I've followed on social media for a bit, and it was through his funny yet consequential take on the events of his life that I became curious about what he would put into a memoir. It is easily one of the most worthwhile books I've read in recent years. This is a thoughtful and evocative walk through a life perspective wholly different from my own, and I benefitted greatly from reading his words.  I cannot recommend this book enough.

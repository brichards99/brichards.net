A big month of reading. 

First of all, it was the best part of the month to be able to read a new Stephen King book. Later was actually a touch shocking and of course really entertaining. Plus I have been trying to dig through a number of King's books I have fond memories of, and for some reason Bag of Bones has always stuck with me. There is a soft spot in my sentiments for cabins the woods, and this story about a haunted one told from the point of view of a haunted writer just feels really good. 

On another note, did you know that the author of Planet of the Apes is also the author of the Bridge Over the River Kwai? There you go.

Also, you have to go read Sapiens. It's big and covers a lot of territory, but the journey is worth it.

So this month I learned that I breath wrong. Or at least, that I could breath much better. I've always been open to life hacks and health hacks and all that stuff since I see no harm in critically investigating little things I can do to make life a little better. It was in the spirit of this that I picked up James Nestor's book (also because I heard an interview with him on a podcast.) Turns out there is a lot to know about breathing, and this book had some really valuable information. It was no fluff bit of self help or pseudo-medicine. This was a well researched, well-written, and very useful book that has given me a lot to think about with regards to how I think about breathing. I recommend.

And then there were some fun books. I love everything I've read by Jonathan Janz, and the Raven was no exception. Brutal, clever storytelling in a thoughtfully described world I am looking forward to reading more about in the future. Dennis E. Taylor has the same appeal but for different reasons. His Bobiverse books are gripping because it's such a fascinating premise -- the political and personal outcomes of a complex, self-replicating mechanical personality with human proclivities and galaxy-spanning capabilities.

Finally, go read Factfulness. This book wound up on my list by way of Bill Gates' recommended reading list. It paints a picture of a world less stratified and more hopeful than I had previously believed, and its message is important.

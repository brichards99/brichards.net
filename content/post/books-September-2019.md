This was a really solid month for books, and there are several here that were stars. Top of the list is The Institute by Stephen King, which is very much a classic King weirdo storyline that brought to mind Firestarter and Carrie, as well as a few other books that had both gripping stories and emotional tugs at the heart. I really enjoyed that one.

The Ruins was a pleasure -- a simple, straightforward horror story that did not let up from beginning to end. Growing Things by Paul Tremblay set my head on fire a little bit. He took some creative turns with the short stories in this book that will pull me back for a re-read soon I'm sure. 

And I'm now a big fan of the Iron Druid books by Kevin Hearne. I think there are six in the series, and I'll make my way through them in short order, no dount. I will say he has a bit of a thing about including busty women with superhuman (in many cases appropriately so) sex appeal. But hey, maybe that's how druids roll.

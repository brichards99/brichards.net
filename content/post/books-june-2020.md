I've been pushing myself to read more poetry, and I've had some terrific recommendations from Stephanie M. Wytovich, with whom I've been working as part of a mentorship program through [Crystal Lake Publishing](https://www.crystallakepub.com/authorcentral/). She has provided so much help with my own writing, and her recommendations for new poets have been spot on.

My favorite read on the poetry tip this month is easily The Devil's Dreamland, which is an entire volume based on the gruesome history of H.H. Holmes, whose killing spree in Chicago I originally read about in [The Devil in the White City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City). Tantlinger's verse is both narrative and vivid, and just a lot of fun to read.

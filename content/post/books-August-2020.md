This was a month for following up on recommendations that I've received from others.

First there were the obligatory 'nexts' for a couple of series: Harry Potter and Harry Dresden. Both were terrific fun and everything I was looking for, although Butcher could not have left us dangling with a bigger cliffhanger in Peace Talks. Don't care. I'll wait for it.

My wife had recommended Rob Lowe's 'Stories . . .' a while ago, and I finally caught up by listening to the audiobook along with her in anticipation of going after his follow up. This man has had such an interesting life, and it's fun to listen in on these stories from an actor who lived through the making of so many big eighties moments.

Dune was everything I had hoped, and reading it was good motivation to consider other books in the series. It's obviously had a huge impact on science fiction and fantasy, and I could easily re-read it soon. So muuch in there, both in terms of story and world-building.

Then there was The Traveling Vampire Show. I've not touched any of Richard Laymon's work before, and this one has frequently been mentioned as the one book I must read, although clearly his other works are supposed to be worth it too. I have to admit that it wasn't what I expected, and I really appreciated the gritty teen perspective on a curious story. A reall good experience.

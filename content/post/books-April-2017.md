Again, not much in the way of notes here, but I will say that Deep Work really had an impact on how I think about my approach to working from day to day. I took it on as kind of twisted book club reading the CMU Alumni association, and while I never got to chat about it with any of my fellow Tartans, I truly enjoyed the reading.

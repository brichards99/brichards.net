Okay, so I did not get to read a whole lot this month. In my defense (not that a guy really needs to defend himself on this kind of thing) I have recently started a new job and I also made a long trip to Japan for the holidays. So the beat and hum of my reading routine has been a bit disrupted.

Yeah, three audiobooks and three slim novels (Elevation was more of a novella, and the Wizard of Oz was, well, a kid's book.) 

Here is something I'll offer from this list, however: Doug Bradley's narration of the Spinechillers audiobook was outstanding. This was an anthology of classic short stories, and I was wrapped up in it for each and every installment. His voice is mesmerizing.

F it -- I don't have detailed notes on these, but I enjoyed them. Silence of the Lambs was far better than I expected, and as much because the movie followed it so closely as anything.

* Callsign Bishop - Jeremy Robinson 
* Pulse - Jeremy Robinson 
* Silence of the Lambs - Thomas Harris 
* Turn of the Screw - Henry James 
* Abandon - Blake Crouch 
* Unmasking Narcissism - Mark Ettensohn

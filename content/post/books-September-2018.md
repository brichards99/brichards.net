I love these Doom books. I'm not ashamed. They're like my version of Danielle Steele, I swear. I read the original Doom series of books (there were four, weren't there?) back when I was substitute teaching and living in my parent's basement. I distinctly remember flopping out on that shitty old fold-out sofa that I used as a bed and reading those books with slavering enjoyment. This new series is by a different author, and as far as I know there are only two Doom 3 books. This one did not have a whole lot in the way of steam demons and imps, but it was bund and captured the feel of the game. Loved it. Wanna fight about it?

The Batman: the Stone King book was another Graphic Audio audiobook that I had obtained as part of a Humble Bundle package, and I have loved every single one of them. I'm a big Batman fan, and something I appreciate about the novelization of the character is the degree to which the Wayne family back story is fleshed out. Fun stuff.

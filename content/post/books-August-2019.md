This was a good month for reading, particularly because I found a few audiobooks that I just absolutely devoured. With my ears. Weird image . . .

Anyway, these David E. Taylor Bob-iverse novels are creative and interesting and funny, and I could read several more. I think he's moved on to other stories, which is disappointing, but these are sci-fi (forgive me, Harlan Ellison) books that I would gladly revisit some day.

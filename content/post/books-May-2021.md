I finished these books during the month of May, 2021.

* [Hell Divers #1 -- Nicholas Sansbury Smith ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28464896-hell-divers)
* [Mexican Gothic -- Silvia Moreno-Garcia ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic)
* [This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race -- Nicole Perlroth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247043-this-is-how-they-tell-me-the-world-ends)
* [The Fog -- James Herbert](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397860.The_Fog)

Well, the true horror I experienced on my reading list this month was Perlroth's book about cyberweapons. It is absolutely phenomenal how much material she has been able to gather over the years as a reporter studying the malware business, and the clarity with which she lays out the details of how things have evolved over time is shocking. I would not recommend this book for people who get anxiety about hackers. I would recommend it for people who know a thing or two about hackers.

But a real pleasure this month was Mexican Gothic. Just absolutely a wonderful gothic novel in a setting I don't read very much. This was skillfully written and gripping. Good, good fun.

It seems that every blog (online diary, journal, self-loving website, etc) that I run across that has been redesigned in Hugo has a post early on about why it was redesigned in Hugo. This seems like a weird thing to do in the wide world of the web, since people are constantly changing the underlying technologies of their website without wasting a lot of time talking about it, but in my case Ima going to do that thing because there is a point to be made about why I have taken the time to do something other than Wordpress. Also, there is something to be said about why I'm doing a blog at all in a year (I won't even bother calling it an 'age' or 'era' because things will likely shift in the world of editor-less publishing again soon) when everyone else seems to be flocking to [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [Steemit](https://steemit.com/).

Primarily I'm doing this as part of my practice as an IT professional. Even though this is a public forum and if you're a human other than myself I'm certainly glad you're reading this, I write this blog to keep my own mind in the game. It's a little project that requires a wee bit of technical twiddling and bit of writing on topics that I use in order to make a living, and in all doing this just helps me better at getting paid.

The technical twiddling is valuable because the mechanics of what I have here have some importance to the work I do as a cloud software developer:

* I'm writing things in Markdown
* I'm developing the work using the Hugo platform, meaning I have to know keep my eye on this platform and how it works
* I'm maintaining the work's materials using Git, stored in Github
* I have some workflow operations happening using TravisCI
* And ultimately things are publishing on Amazon
* With Google DNS to top it off

So with all those moving parts I feel like I'm keeping my hands in the toolbox just enough to learn a few things. Wordpress, on the other hand, is a really great publishing platform if you don't really want to know how the sausage is made. Which is fine, but I do want to know how the sausage is made.

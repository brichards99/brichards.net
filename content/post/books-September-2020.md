Work has been ramping up for me, so I didn't get in as much reading this month as I would like. I will say that The Only Good Indians was really good, and delivered a different kind of a horror story than I've been reading. It was a good reminder that I have Jones' Last Final Girl on my Kindle waiting to be read, so I'll go pick that up next.

The following were books I finished reading during the month of June.

* [The God Gene - F.Paul Wilson](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071X4N8DP/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)
* [10% Happier - Dan Harris](https://www.amazon.com/10-Happier-Revised-Self-Help-Works-ebook/dp/B07R4NMHJ2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1563222950&sr=1-2)
* [Castaways - Brian Keene](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J2HXWQ/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title)

Not a huge list this month, although these were each really worth the time. This is only natural I suppose since it's been a long time since I've tried to force myself to push through to the end of a clunker. There just seems to be no point in finishing a bad book.

10% Happier is something I would recommend to others without hesitation. I meditate daily, so there is no need to sell me on the subject, but I found it fascinating to read Dan Harris' discovery process as he progressed as a journalist through many of the 'happiness formulae' that gurus like Deepok Chopra and Rhonda Byrne have shared, finally landing on good old mindfulness meditation in its many forms. His pragmatic explanation of what this did for him and how he has chosen to share it with others is really effective.

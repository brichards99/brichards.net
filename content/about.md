Brian is a lifelong poet and reader, as well as a teacher and software developer. He spends his days at a keyboard dreaming up either horror or code, and sometimes both. He is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and the Horror Writers Association. 

As an instructor he has taught college courses since 1999, focusing on technology topics such as networking, systems administration, web development, and information security.

Brian currently works as a software developer specializing in ServiceNow, a cloud-based IT Service Management platform. He has over twenty years of experience as a technologist in roles such as instructional designer, system administrator, SAN administrator, and IT manager.

To prepare for these last two jobs Brian has earned two Masterâ€™s degrees: one in instructional technology and one in information technology security and assurance. Before that, however, he earned a degree in English Education.

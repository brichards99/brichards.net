Brian currently works as a software developer specializing in ServiceNow, a cloud-based IT Service Management platform. He has over twenty years of experience as a technologist in roles such as instructional designer, system administrator, SAN administrator, and IT manager. At the same time he has been teaching courses in technology at several universities both on ground and online.

Brian has earned two Master’s degrees: one in instructional technology and one in information technology security and assurance. He is a serial certifier, having earned many certifications from Microsoft, VMWare, CompTIA, and ITIL over the years, and all those test questions have also given him strong opinions about what does and doesn’t work in IT.

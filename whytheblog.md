#the one about why I made this blog in Hugo

It seems that every blog (online diary, journal, self-loving website, etc) that I run across that has been redesigned in Hugo has a post early on about why it was redesigned in Hugo. This seems like a weird thing to do in the wide world of the web, since people are constantly changing the underlying technologies of their website without wasting a lot of time talking about it, but in my case Ima going to do that thing because there is a point to be made about why I have taken the time to do something other than Wordpress. Also, there is something to be said about why I'm doing a blog at in a year (I won't even bother calling it an 'age' or 'era' because things will likely shift in the world of editor-less publishing again soon) when everyone else seems to be flocking to [Medium](https://medium.com/) or [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) or [Steemit](https://steemit.com/).

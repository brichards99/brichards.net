</ul>

<p>It was a pretty thin month for reading this September, but that&rsquo;s okay. I had fun.</p>

<p>The novelizations for the game Doom were candy-like cheap fun when I read them the first time through, and I digging into Knee-Deep in the Dead took me right back to those days of reading cheap paperbacks while crashed out on a pull-out sofa in my parents&rsquo; basement. I clearly remember that it was at a time when I was subsitute teaching in my old high school for $40 a day, mooching off my parents, and trying to pretend that I had not completely wasted five years earning a degree in English Education.</p>

<p>I may not have completed wasted those years, but the fact is that I don&rsquo;t teach English now, so that says something.</p>

<p>I was unhappy then as you might expect, and reading stuff like Knee-Deep in the Dead took me far, far away from what I was doing, and to be frank I do not care one whit how poor these books are. They&rsquo;re fun, and they took me into a world that I knew fairly well from playing the games for years.</p>

<p>Doom 3, by Matthew Costello, by the way, is another level. It&rsquo;s a sharply written book that doesn&rsquo;t happen to deliver on the frantic fight-for-your-life experience of the earlier novels, but I don&rsquo;t care. It sets up a sequel that I just added to my list of books to purchase some soon day, and I can&rsquo;t wait until I get to it.</p>

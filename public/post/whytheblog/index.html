      <h1>the one about why I made this blog in Hugo</h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 1, 2018</span>
      <p class="post-content"><p>It seems that every blog (online diary, journal, self-loving website, etc) that I run across that has been redesigned in Hugo has a post early on about why it was redesigned in Hugo. This seems like a weird thing to do in the wide world of the web, since people are constantly changing the underlying technologies of their website without wasting a lot of time talking about it, but in my case Ima going to do that thing because there is a point to be made about why I have taken the time to do something other than Wordpress. Also, there is something to be said about why I&rsquo;m doing a blog at all in a year (I won&rsquo;t even bother calling it an &lsquo;age&rsquo; or &lsquo;era&rsquo; because things will likely shift in the world of editor-less publishing again soon) when everyone else seems to be flocking to <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> or <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> or <a href="https://steemit.com/">Steemit</a>.</p>

<p>Primarily I&rsquo;m doing this as part of my practice as an IT professional. Even though this is a public forum and if you&rsquo;re a human other than myself I&rsquo;m certainly glad you&rsquo;re reading this, I write this blog to keep my own mind in the game. It&rsquo;s a little project that requires a wee bit of technical twiddling and bit of writing on topics that I use in order to make a living, and in all doing this just helps me better at getting paid.</p>

<p>The technical twiddling is valuable because the mechanics of what I have here have some importance to the work I do as a cloud software developer:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m writing things in Markdown</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m developing the work using the Hugo platform, meaning I have to know keep my eye on this platform and how it works</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m maintaining the work&rsquo;s materials using Git, stored in Github</li>
<li>I have some workflow operations happening using TravisCI</li>
<li>And ultimately things are publishing on Amazon</li>
<li>With Google DNS to top it off</li>
</ul>

<p>So with all those moving parts I feel like I&rsquo;m keeping my hands in the toolbox just enough to learn a few things. Wordpress, on the other hand, is a really great publishing platform if you don&rsquo;t really want to know how the sausage is made. Which is fine, but I do want to know how the sausage is made.</p>

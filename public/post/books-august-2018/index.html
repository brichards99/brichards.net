      <p class="post-content"><p>The following were books I finished reading during the month of August.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Troop-Nick-Cutter-ebook/dp/B00BSBR5DA/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The Troop - Nick Cutter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036S4C5C/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i11">Ice Cold: A Rizzoli and Isles Nove - Tess Gerritsen</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the books I read this month, but the standout title for me has to be Ice Cold. I had picked this one up on a goof because I thought that it was a television tie-in kind of like the Nikki Heat books with Castle. The story quickly pulled me in and I found myself completely taken away by the writing. Once I finished it and realized how much I wanted to read more I forced myself to do the smart thing and look into the author, Tess Gerritsen. I learned that Gerritsen&rsquo;s Rizzoli and Isles novels predate the show &ndash; rather than the other way around &ndash; and while the show is fine the novels apparently outclass them easily. I will be looking further into this series.</p>

<p>Another standout this month, by the way, was Paul Tremblay&rsquo;s The Little Sleep. Before his current round of well known horror novels (such as Head Full of Ghosts, which rocks) Tremblay wrote a few detective novels around a narcolepticwith some curious detecting to do. Straightforward, readable, and interesting. There is a bit of formulaic noir going on here, but that&rsquo;s what you read these kind of books for, right?</p>

<p>This month I took advantage of Humble Bundle&rsquo;s DC Comics offering, which included a bunch of audiobooks from Graphic Audio. Both the Wonder Womand and the Wayne of Gotham books were gripping, exciting, fun &ndash; all that. Final Crisis, on the other hand, was a book I probably would have enjoyed more if I had a better background in DC storylines. And perhaps if I had read some of the previous series, such as 52. Also may have been better to have simply read it on paper.</p>

<p>Two absolutely terrific books this month were Any Man by AMber Tamblyn and The Cabin at the End of the World by Paul Tremblay. Any Man is a unique read, with a narrative style that I would hate to say sounds just like what a poet would do, but it sounds just like what a poet such as Amber Tamblyn would do. Timely as well, to read a novel of men being victimized using character experiences often associated with female victimes of male predators. Timely in that it was a good poke in the male perspective for me, a male reader, at a time when male peoples all around really need to be thinking outside their own testerone soaked ideas.</p>

<p>Now The Cabin at the End of the World was just fun. Straightforward narrative and a story that evolved in a way that really makes you question what is happening. Or what the charactes think is happening. It&rsquo;s good. Go read it.</p>

      <description>Alices Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll Clowns Versus Spiders by Jeff Strand Dances with Dragons by George R.R. Martin The Sorrows by Jonathan Janz Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow Permanent Record by Edward Snowden Spider-Man: The Darkest Hours by Jim Butcher Caliban&#39;s War by James S.A. Corey  So here were a number of fun books &amp;ndash; definitely had a good month. Clowns Vs. Spiders was a surprise, since I started reading it merely because the title sounded fun and campy, and I should have known that I was in for much more.</description>

      <description>The following were books I finished reading during the month of August.
 Click Here to Kill Everybody - Bruce Schneier  The Best American Mystery Stories For We Are Many - Dennis E. Taylor All These Worlds - Dennis E. We Have Always Lived In the Castle - Shirley Jackson Godzilla - King of the Monsters - Greg Keyes The Churn - James S.A. Corey  This was a good month for reading, particularly because I found a few audiobooks that I just absolutely devoured.</description>

      <description>The following were books I finished reading during the month of July.
 Stranger Things Darkness on the Edge of Town - Adam Christopher Quiet - Susan Cain I&#39;ll Be Gone in the Dark - Michelle McNamara  I really got swept up in &amp;ldquo;I&#39;ll Be Gone in the Dark.&amp;rdquo; I have not read a whole lot of true crime stuff before, and something that I really appreciated about this was learning so much of McNamara&#39;s personal ups and downs with her investigations.</description>

      <description>The following were books I finished reading during the month of June.
 The God Gene - F.Paul Wilson 10% Happier - Dan Harris Castaways - Brian Keene  Not a huge list this month, although these were each really worth the time. This is only natural I suppose since it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve tried to force myself to push through to the end of a clunker. There just seems to be no point in finishing a bad book.</description>

      <description>I finished these books during the month of May, 2019.
 Anansi Boys - Neil Gaiman Killer Crabs - Guy N. Smith The Meg - Steve Alten The Consuming Fire - John Scalzi The Necroscope - Brian Lumley Alien III - William Gibson  These books were fantastic. All of them. The reading I did this month reminded me of summers hunkered in my bedroom, sweating from the heat (because we had no air conditioning upstairs in our house) flipping through the grainy pages of books I had scooped up at Waldenbooks in between drooling over the manuals in the Dungeons and Dragons section and walking past the arcade wishing I had the quarters to play.</description>

      <description>I finished these books during the month of April, 2019.
 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business - Charles Duhigg The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living - Meik Wiking The Lost Level - Brian Keene Under the Empyrean Sky - Chuck Wendig The Buddha Walks Into a Bar - Lodro Rinzler  The Power of Habit fascinated me, and it&#39;s a book that I think I might go back to from time to time.</description>

      <description>Leviathan Wakes - James S.A. Corey Tribesmen: A Novella of Supernatural Cannibal Horror - Adam Cesare Fear: Trump in the White House - Bob Woodward No More Mr. Nice Guy - Robert Glover  Leviathan Wakes &amp;ndash; which naturally is the lead off novel of the Expanse series &amp;ndash; certainly lived up to the hype. I was a bit hesitant to get started with because sometimes I just don&#39;t want to start a book that will feel like slog to get through, and often epic space novels are like that.</description>

      <description>Books finished during February 2019:
 You Are Here - Thich Nat Hanh Hack: A LitRPG Novel (Tower of Gates Book 1) - Paul Bellow Hunter Hunterson &amp;amp; Sons - Scott Sigler  Pretty light work this month. I had a lot going on with my job, so I was somewhat distracted.
I&#39;ll say this &amp;ndash; I love me some Scott Sigler. He&#39;s somewhat crude, especially in this Hunter Hunterson &amp;amp; Sons volume (which is really just a small collection of short stories.</description>

      <description>I got 2019 off to a good start by reading the following this month:
 City of Ghosts - V.E. Schwab &amp;lsquo;Salem&#39;s Lot - Stephen King Zen: Beginner&#39;s Guide - Ian Tuhovsky  Seems like kind of a paltry list, but these were good, solid reads.
I make no excuses about City of Ghosts &amp;ndash; it is a young adult book. Fine. Sue me. I have heard so many good things about Schwab&#39;s writing, and I think this story gave me solid proof that the rumors were true.</description>

      <description>Alive &amp;ndash; Scott Sigler The Flash: Stop Motion &amp;ndash;  Spinechillers &amp;ndash; various] Doom 2: Hell on Earth - Dafydd an Hugh Elevation - Stephen King The Wizard of Oz - Frank Baum  Okay, so I did not get to read a whole lot this month. In my defense (not that a guy really needs to defend himself on this kind of thing) I have recently started a new job and I also made a long trip to Japan for the holidays.</description>

      <description>Visions of Fire &amp;ndash; Gillian Anderson Solo &amp;ndash; Mur Lafferty Bored and Brilliant &amp;ndash; Manoush Zamorodi A Feast of Crows &amp;ndash; George R.R. Martin  I have to admit to being a little disappointed in the Visions of Fire book from Gillian Anderson. I had been looking forward to reading this for some time, and I found it to be somewhat flighty. A really interesting premise, however, and I will likely give the next book a shot to see where the story goes.</description>

      <description>Nightmares and Dreamscapes part three by Stephen King Wanderers by Chuck Wendig Daredevil: the Man without Fear by Paul Crilley Earthworm Gods by Brian Keene  Lots of fun stuff this month. It goes without saying that Wanderers by Chuck Wendig was a long, enjoyable ride worth recommending to everyone. The book has been popular since its really, and rightly so. It&#39;s a bit of a hopeful apocalyptic story, but maybe I have a screwed up perspective on the end of the world.</description>

      <description>American Demon Hunters &amp;ndash; J. Thorn Frankenstein: Prodigal Son - Dean Koontz No Sleep til Wonderland &amp;ndash; Paul Tremblay Little Slaughterhoues on the Prairie &amp;ndash; Harold Schecter  I read American Dream Hunters because I participated in a writing workshop (called Night of the Writing Dead) hosted by the author, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. This isn&#39;t exactly Shirley Jackson, but at the same time it was tightly written and comprised of a very interesting premise.</description>

      <description>ServiceNow Developers Handbook - Tim Woodruff Knee-Deep in the Dead - Dafydd ab Hugh Batman Inferno - Alex Irvine Doom 3 - Matthew Costello  It was a pretty thin month for reading this September, but that’s okay. I had fun.
The novelizations for the game Doom were candy-like cheap fun when I read them the first time through, and I digging into Knee-Deep in the Dead took me right back to those days of reading cheap paperbacks while crashed out on a pull-out sofa in my parents’ basement.</description>

Stine guy, having been born about a decade late to really appreciate his books when I was the right age for them.</description>

      <description>Over time I have owned both a hardcover copy and the audio-cassette version of From a Buick 8, yet I&#39;ve never finished it. The story is set in Western Pennsylvania here and throws a local bone out every once in a while, but the premise of it all is genuinely fascinating. A kind of totem of the kind of cross-universe fantasy Stephen King has introduced in so many of his books.</description>

      <description>Each of these books brought its own enjoyment, but it was Joe Hill&#39;s Stange Weather that really got my imagination going. These stories took me away like a gripping episode of the Outer Limits. I feel like an asshole that I have not found anyone to recommend this book to yet.
 Burnt Offerings - Robert Morasco Alone - Scott Sigler Z-Burbia - Jake Bible Atlanta Burns - Chuck Wendig The Fold - Peter Clines Mockingbird - Chuck Wendig Agent to the Stars - John Scalzi Astrophysics for People in a Hurry - Neil deGrasse Tyson Strange Weather - Joe Hill  </description>

      <description>This was actually a pretty heavy month of reading, and there were two books here I would gladly revisit. Sleeping Beauties carried me through a whole world, very much in the flavor of other Stephen King books. His collaboration with his son is really enjoyable storytelling.
And then there is the Tomb. Wilson&#39;s story has all the ingredients for a meaty thriller, and it&#39;s a good justification for me to push into the rest of his books, which I know includes the really well regarded Repairman Jack series.</description>

      <description>Again, not much in the way of notes here, but I will say that Deep Work really had an impact on how I think about my approach to working from day to day. I took it on as kind of twisted book club reading the CMU Alumni association, and while I never got to chat about it with any of my fellow Tartans, I truly enjoyed the reading.

      <description>F it &amp;ndash; I don&#39;t have detailed notes on these, but I enjoyed them. Silence of the Lambs was far better than I expected, and as much because the movie followed it so closely as anything.

      <description>Joe Haldeman. Damn. The Forever War was a terrific read.
I&#39;ll also say that I don&#39;t know of anyone who reads Jeremy Robinson, but his books are a blast. I particularly like the kaiju ones, but they&#39;re all fun, fast reads.

      <description>I never read Terry Brooks back in high school when I was, you know, scheduled to do so by way of my active participation in the girl-less nerds of D&amp;amp;D club. I really missed out, so now I am burdened with having to dig through these beautiful, thick, well worn books as an adult. Darn.

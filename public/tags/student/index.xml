      <description>Obligatory preamble: This post is intended for students in any of my online classes. I post entries in this blog in order to help you succeed in the unique environment of an online college course, which I hope you realize is a lot different than other kinds of classes.
So here we go with a new year. This is the time when everyone is making resolutions and getting pumped up for a new fitness routine, a cleaner house, or maybe a new adventure.</description>

      <title>Writing tips for my students</title>

      <description>Since I am in the middle of grading a large batch of final papers for a class I feel inspired to write down some tips for my future students (since these tips ain&#39;t helping my current classes.)
You earn your A’s in an online class through writing, plain and simple. Because most hands-on class activities are simply impractical, written papers and online discussion forums take up the bulk of how you’re evaluated in just about every online class, and certainly of every online class I teach.</description>

      <description>Those who have had me for class before have seen this post before.
An important part of every IT professional’s job is continuing education. For the most part we see this as attending conferences and signing up for classes related to new technologies, but one of the simplest (and cheapest) things is to simply stay informed. For anyone in this field, but infosec professionals in particular, Bruce Schneier’s Crypto-gram newsletter is an invaluable source of information about current events.</description>

      <title>Citing Sources in academic papers</title>
      <link>https://www.brichards.net/citingsources/</link>

      <description>When should you cite your sources?
There are two reasons, for the most part, where a writer should say to himself or herself, “Hey, I should make sure I cite some references here.” The first and most important reason is a deliberate choice you’ve made to back up your own writing with someone else’s writing in order to make it clear that not only did you have a good idea, but your good idea can be supported by reading someone else’s thoughts on the subject you&#39;re talking about.</description>

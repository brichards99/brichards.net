      <description>So earlier today I had a little bit of time to kill because of an instance upgrade, so I decided to retake my ServiceNow Certified System Administrator certification. Which is kind of a mouthful, but it&#39;s just not that important to enough people for there to be a handy acronym like CCNA or SAT.
But it&#39;s important to me, and I passed. Woo!
For people who work on the ServiceNow platform the system administrator certification is the most common shingle to seek, and it demonstrates that I know enough about where all the levers and gears are in ServiceNow to be permitted admin access without everyone else in the organization sweating bullets.</description>

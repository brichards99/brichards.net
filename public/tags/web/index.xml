      <description>It seems that every blog (online diary, journal, self-loving website, etc) that I run across that has been redesigned in Hugo has a post early on about why it was redesigned in Hugo. This seems like a weird thing to do in the wide world of the web, since people are constantly changing the underlying technologies of their website without wasting a lot of time talking about it, but in my case Ima going to do that thing because there is a point to be made about why I have taken the time to do something other than Wordpress.</description>
